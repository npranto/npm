#Node Package Manager (NPM)
    NPM is used to install different libraries, tools and packages for application functionality needs. It is a Command
    Line Interface(CLI) that keeps track of application software or packages or modules

## Installing NPM
    * Make sure Node.js is installed on machine (go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and manually install the software)
    * To ensure, type "node -v" on the terminal to check for a version to pop-up

## To Keep track of all packages
    * create a file called, "package.json" OR on the terminal, navigate to current project and type "npm init" to
      automatically create a "package.json" file
    * Each "package.json" file must have two keys with value, "name" and "version"
